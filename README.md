  - #Assign `employee_id` to a four digit number as an initial value
  - employee_id = 4186
  - #Display the data type of `employee_id
  - print(type(employee_id))
  - #Reassign `employee_id` to the same value but in the form of a string
  - employee_id = str(employee_id)
  - #Display the data type of `employee_id` now
  - print(type(employee_id)) ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49b12c9a-79da-4020-850b-b13c52997576)
